# Software Engineering 2 Project, Politecnico di Milano (A.Y. 2021/22)
The objective of this project is to apply in practice what we have learnt during lectures with the purpose of
becoming familiar with software engineering practices and be able to address new software engineering
issues in a rigorous way. The project includes two assignments:
1. The preparation of a Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) for the problem provided.
2. The definition of the Design Document (DD) for the system considered in point 1 above.

# The Problem: DREAM
## What is DREAM?
**Data-driven Predictive Farming** in Telengana, or DREAM, is an elaboration of an initiative presented to the professors 
of the class by their colleagues working at [UNDP](https://www.in.undp.org/) India, a United Nations division and within 
the [Healthsites](https://www.healthsites.io/) initiative. The initiative was promoted by Telengana's government.

## Context
Agriculture plays a pivotal role in India’s economy as over 58% of rural households depend on
it as the principal means of livelihood, 80% of whom are smallholder farmers with less than 2 hectares
of farmland. More than a fifth of the smallholder farm households are below poverty. Globally there
will be 9.7 billion people in the world by 2050 (as per a recent UN estimate). Food demand is expected
to increase anywhere between 59% to 98% by 2050 (source Harvard Business Review). Climate change
continues to be a real and potent threat to the agriculture sector, which will impact everything from
productivity to livelihoods across food and farm systems and is predicted to result in a 4%-26% loss in
net farm income towards the end of the century. This calls for a revamp of the entire mechanism that
brings food from farms to our plates. The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly highlighted the massive
disruption caused in food supply chains exposing the vulnerabilities of marginalized communities, small
holder farmers and the importance of building resilient food systems. It has become even more
important now that we develop and adopt innovative methodologies and technologies that can help
bolster countries against food supply shocks and challenges.

## Telengana's Goal
Telengana’s long-term goal: Telengana is the 11th largest state in India with a geographical area of
112,077 km2 and 35,193,978 residents (data from 2011) (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana
for more details). The goal of Telengana’s government is to design, develop and demonstrate
anticipatory governance models for food systems using digital public goods and community-centric
approaches to strengthen data-driven policy making in the state.
This will require the involvement of multiple stakeholders, from normal citizens to policy makers,
farmers, market analysts, agronomists, etc. 

### Data Collection
In the first place, Telengana wants to partner with IT providers with the aim of acquiring and combining:
- Data concerning meteorological short-term and long-term forecasts. Telengana already collects
and makes available such data (see https://www.tsdps.telangana.gov.in/aws.jsp).
- Information provided by the farmers about their production (types of products, produced
amount per product).
- Information obtained by the water irrigation system concerning the amount of water used by
each farmer.
- Information obtained by sensors deployed on the territory and measuring the humidity of soil.
- Information obtained by the governmental agronomists who periodically visit the farms in their
areas.


Acquiring and combining such data, DREAMS will support the work of three types of actors: policy
makers, farmers, and agronomists. In the following we describe the needs of each category of actor.


### Telengana’s policy makers 
They want to:
- Identify those farmers who are performing well, especially when they demonstrate to be
resilient to meteorological adverse events, as these farmers will receive special incentives and
will be asked to provide useful best practices to the others.
- Identify those farmers who need to be helped as they are performing particularly badly.
- Understand whether the steering initiatives carried out by agronomists with the help of good
farmers produce significant results.


### Farmers
They want to:
- Visualize data relevant to them – for instance, weather forecasts, personalized suggestions
concerning specific crops to plant or specific fertilizers to use – based on their location and type
of production.
- Insert in the system data about their production and any problem they face.
- Request for help and suggestions by agronomists and other farmers.
- Create discussion forums with the other farmers.


### Agronomists
They want to:
- Insert the area they are responsible of.
- Receive information about requests for help and answer to these requests.
- Visualize data concerning weather forecasts in the area and the best performing farmers in the
area.
- Visualize and update a daily plan to visit farms in the area, assuming that all farms must be
visited at least twice a year, but those that are under-performing should be visited more often,
depending on the type of problem they are facing.
- Confirm the execution of the daily plan at the end of each day or specify the deviations from the
plan.
